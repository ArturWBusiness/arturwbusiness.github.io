        <p class="title">Today I present my small attempt on tower defence games and pyglet</p>
        <p>Some time has passed and here I am showcasing my tower defence template game using pyglet in python3. This is only my first attempt so the code looks very unprofessional and to me honest, it is simply messy. You can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/ArturWBusiness/RPG/blob/master/main.py">github.com/ArturWBusiness/RPG/blob/master/main.py<><br />I believe that at a first attempt I was able to do good enought. Well that is all I have to say for now! Have a great day. PS, still don't have spell checker in my editor... sorry...</p>
