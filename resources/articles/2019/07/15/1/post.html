            After a long break I am back in developement. However now in java
            The application doesnt have a goal as of now because I mainly want to get 
            a system done that can self update itself and have an account system.<br>
            There is no server is still in developement as well so the app will not 
            login no matter what. The app can be accessed by clicking the button Dev App 
            in the top menu bar.
