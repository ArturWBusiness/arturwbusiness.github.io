							I had some free time today so I decided to add an image once you hover over. I was also able to make Projects work now. You can check one of my projects and see what I have done. It took me few hours as I simply wanted to make the adding process quick and simple. Well also more information was added as well.<br />
							See you soon as the site grows!
